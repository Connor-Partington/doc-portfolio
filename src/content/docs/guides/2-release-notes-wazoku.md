While working at [Wazoku](https://support.wazoku.com/), I wrote monthly release notes to help users find out about the latest changes to the Wazoku Platform. The Wazoku Platform is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Idea Management platform that provides organizations with a structured method to capture, evaluate, prioritize, select, and implement ideas to address business problems.

**Tools used: Markdown, HubSpot, Jira, GIMP**

## What’s new

### Challenge extras: Automatically assign Idea Managers

You can now [automatically assign Idea Managers](https://support.wazoku.com/turn-on-automatic-assignment-of-idea-managers) to ideas when they reach a certain stage within your Challenge. This can help you save time, streamline idea management, and assign specialists to the ideas submitted to your Challenge. Learn more about it on [Connect](https://connect.balbu.wazoku.com/idea/84f9df2c230042c8853d374e0b9e4241?).

### Challenge stage: Create tasks for updating ideas

You can now decide if a task should be created to [ask users to update their ideas](https://support.wazoku.com/automatically-create-tasks-for-updating-ideas) when they reach a stage where the 'Edit ideas' setting is enabled. This gives you more control over your Challenge workflow and when a task should be sent to a user. Learn more about it on [Connect](https://connect.balbu.wazoku.com/idea/9d0dda92cfad466cb0333ff3fc293ec9?).

## Improvements

### Challenge and idea pages: Enhanced workflow view

We’ve updated the workflow view on the Challenge and idea pages to improve the overall user experience. When you view the workflow, you’ll now see the stage names in full instead of an ellipse (…), the number of ideas in a stage, and when each stage will open/close.

### Create private Challenges outside of communities

You can now [create a private Challenge](https://support.wazoku.com/create-a-private-challenge) at any level within the platform. Previously this was restricted to only be allowed within communities. Learn more about it on [Connect](https://connect.balbu.wazoku.com/idea/07dee7e39b5146bc91538b7968bbbbb8?).

## Bug fixes

* An error occurred when trying to save a Challenge after turning off all the activities within the “Completed” stage. Now the completed stage can be saved with no activities selected.
* When trying to create a new keyword, that contains a word that already exists within an existing keyword, the system automatically selects the existing keyword instead of creating a new one.
