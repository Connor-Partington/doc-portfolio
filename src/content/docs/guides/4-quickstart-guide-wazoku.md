While working at [Wazoku](https://support.wazoku.com/), I wrote quickstart guides to help each user type get started on the Wazoku Platform. The Wazoku Platform is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Idea Management platform that provides organizations with a structured method to capture, evaluate, prioritize, select, and implement ideas to address business problems.

**Tools used: Markdown, HubSpot, Jira, GIMP**

# Quickstart guide for Admins

Welcome to the Wazoku Platform! As an [administrator](https://support.wazoku.com/types-of-user-roles), you have control over all of the settings throughout your platform. To get started, you’ll need to configure access and security settings, invite more users, and manage your new platform.

## 1. Configure access and security

First, set the overall [access level of your platform](https://support.wazoku.com/manage-access-to-your-platform). Once you've done that, configure the [password requirements](https://support.wazoku.com/manage-password-settings) for your users, and then decide if you want to use [multi-factor authentication](https://support.wazoku.com/manage-multi-factor-authentication).

## 2. Learn the basics

You’ll use [Challenges](https://support.wazoku.com/what-is-a-challenge-1) to find a structured solution to a well-formed problem statement. You can [create a Challenge](https://support.wazoku.com/create-a-new-challenge) for anything you'd like, and [add an Idea](https://support.wazoku.com/add-a-new-idea) to test the Challenge workflow. If you’d like to work with people from other organizations, you can [create a Co-creation Community](https://support.wazoku.com/create-a-new-co-creation-community), or you might want to [create an Idea Space](https://support.wazoku.com/create-a-new-idea-space) to collaborate with your team members.

## 3. Get it looking good

After you’ve learned the basics, it’s time to [customize your platform appearance](https://support.wazoku.com/customize-your-platform-appearance) to give it a unique look and feel that matches your organization’s branding. You can then [customize your home page](https://support.wazoku.com/customize-your-home-page) and decide what your users will see when they first log in. If it’s fun and interactive, it’ll be more appealing to your audience and can help to promote Challenges, Conversations, and Ideas.

## 4. Invite people to your platform

Now that your platform is ready, let's [invite new users to your platform](https://support.wazoku.com/invite-new-users-to-your-platform). When a user has joined your platform, you’ll want to [change their user role](https://support.wazoku.com/change-a-users-role) to ensure they have the best role for their responsibilities.

## 5. Help your users get started

With your platform set up and new users joining, you can help them get started by sharing the following articles:

* [Log in to your account](https://support.wazoku.com/log-in-to-your-account)
* [What is the Wazoku Platform?](https://support.wazoku.com/what-is-the-wazoku-platform)
* [Get to know the interface](https://support.wazoku.com/get-to-know-the-interface)

## 6. Connect your favorite apps

Connect to the apps your team already knows and eliminate the need to constantly switch between apps. You can seamlessly interact with the platform in [Microsoft Teams](https://support.wazoku.com/connect-microsoft-teams-to-your-platform), send Ideas back and forth to [Jira](https://support.wazoku.com/connect-jira-to-your-platform), or configure [social logins](https://support.wazoku.com/configure-social-logins) and [storage solutions](https://support.wazoku.com/configure-storage-solutions).
