While working at [Wazoku](https://support.wazoku.com/), I wrote this how-to guide to teach users how to create a new Challenge on the Wazoku Platform. The Wazoku Platform is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Idea Management platform that provides organizations with a structured method to capture, evaluate, prioritize, select, and implement ideas to address business problems.

**Tools used: Markdown, HubSpot, Jira, GIMP**

# Create a new Challenge
 
[Challenges](https://support.wazoku.com/what-is-a-challenge-1) bring the right ideas and people together to solve real-world and everyday problems in a dedicated workspace where everyone has the chance to see their ideas become a reality.

> **Who can do this?** Admins and Managers can create Challenges on the platform or within assigned Idea Spaces and Co-creation Communities.

> **Is this your first Challenge?** Read our in-depth guide on [how to create your first Challenge](https://support.wazoku.com/create-your-first-challenge).

## Create a Challenge

1. Go to your home page.
2. Select **Create** > **Challenge**.
3. On the **General** tab, enter the required Challenge details.
4. On the **Forms** tab, select a form you’ll use to accept Idea submissions.
5. On the **Workflow** tab, add and configure your workflow stages.
6. On the **Extras** tab, customize the Challenge with any extras such as a rating system or reward.
7. On the **Dashboard** tab, choose who can see your Challenge analytics dashboards.
8. Click **Publish**.

> **Tip**: If you’re not ready to publish the Challenge just yet, you can click **Save as Draft** and come back to it later.
