description: An example of a video script for a video guide.

While working at [Wazoku](https://support.wazoku.com/), I scripted, recorded, and edited video guides to help people understand how to use the Wazoku Platform. This is one example of a script I created at the time for the Wazoku [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Wazoku) and [Academy guides](https://www.wazoku.com/wazoku-academy/) videos. The Wazoku Platform is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Idea Management platform that provides organizations with a structured method to capture, evaluate, prioritize, select, and implement ideas to address business problems.

| Hi, I’m [presenter_name] from Wazoku. In this video, we’ll learn how to create a dashboard on Advanced Analytics.  | Animated list of curriculum (displays each curriculum topic one after the other, matched to the audio.) | 30-40 |
| Let’s get started with the usecase. | Transition | 0-10 |
| The dashboard we build today is based on the usecase of a Challenge Manager who wants to understand more about user engagement on their Challenge. | Video: Show usecase on screen. | 15 |
| Now that you know what it is, let’s take a look at what our ideal dashabord will look like. | Transition | 0-10 |
| The dashboard we create will contain the following widgets: <br><br><ul><li>Number of Ideas</li><li>Number of Users</li><li>Number of Accepted Ideas</li><li>Ideas Submitted over Time</li><li>Ideas by Stage and Status</li><li>User Leaderboard</li></ul> | Video: Animated list of the widgets we will create, and a fullscreen view of the dashboard we’ll have at the end of this video. |  |
| With that out of the way, let’s learn how to build the dashboard. | Transition | 0-10 |
| The first step is to [Create a new dashboard](https://support.wazoku.com/create-a-dashboard), to do this: <br><br><ol><li>Go to your platform home page.</li><li>Select **Analytics**.</li><li>Next to **Dashboards**, click the ➕ **Plus** and select **New Dashboard**.</li><li>Click **Choose Data Source** and select the **Activity Dataset**. </li><li>Click **Title** and enter a name for your dashboard. </li><li>Click **Create**.</li></ol><br><br> When you create the dashboard, it’ll initially be empty. | Video: Record screen and click through steps to create an empty dashboard. | 30-40 |
| The next step is to add a widget to your dashboard to visualize your data. <br><br><ol><li>Under **New Widget**, click **Select Data**.</li><li>Type “Idea ID” into the search and select it from the **Idea Table**.</li><li>Click **Advanced Configuration**.</li></ol><br><br> You should now be on the default widget creation page. <br><br><ol><li>Drag and drop the **Idea ID** field from the **Rows** section into the **Values** section.</li><li>Change the chart type from **Pivot** to **Indicator**.</li><li>Double-click on the field name, and rename it to “Number of Ideas”</li></ol>| Video: Record screen and click through steps to create the first widget. | 30-40 |
| (Additional content cut for example) | ... | ... |
| Finally, we will add a User Leaderboard. We want to retain the earlier widget filter on the Number of Users widget, so lets duplicate that widget to get this started. <br><br><ol><li>Change the chart type from **Indicator** to **Pivot**.</li><li>Click the **Trashbin** to remove the **Number of Users** field from **Values**.</li><li>In the **Rows** section, click the ➕ **Plus**.</li><li>Type “User Link” into the search and select it from the **User Table**.</li><li>In the **Values** section, click the ➕ **Plus**.</li><li>Type “Points” into the search and select it from the **Activity Table**.</li></ol><br><br> The User Link column generates a link for each entity in the table, so for our example, it links back to each users profile. You can use links in the Challenge, Community, Conversation, and Idea Tables. <br><br> The Total Points column sums up all the gamification points a user has scored on the filtered challenge. <br><br> To display everything in the correct order: <br><br><ol><li>Hover over the **Points** column header and click the **Sort** icon.</li><li>Select **Sort Descending**.</li></ol><br><br> Then to show only the top 10 users: <br><br><ol><li>Hover over the **User Link** field under **Rows**, and click the **Filter** icon.</li><li>Select the **Ranking** tab.</li><li>Click **OK**.</li><li>Click **Set a Title**, and enter “User Leaderboard”</li><li>Click **Apply** to save the widget.</li></ol><br><br> A final rearrangement of the widgets and we have successfully created our first dashboard. | Video: Record screen and click through steps to duplicate a widget and add a widget for the User Leaderboard. | 100-110 |
| And there you have it. You’ve now completed the [Building a Dashboard](#) module of the [Advanced Analytics Course](#). | Video: Animated video of module completion, think centered text and confetti pops. | 0-10 |
|  | Transition | 0-5 |
| Thanks for watching! | Video: Animated branded outro: <br><br><ul><li>Wazoku branding</li><li>Company name</li><li>Thank you or see you next time message.</li></ul> | 0-5 |
