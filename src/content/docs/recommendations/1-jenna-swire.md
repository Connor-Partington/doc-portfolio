description: A recommendation given to Connor by a former manager.
---

**March 6, 2023, Jenna managed Connor directly.**

Connor is a true self starter, driving both his knowledge of the products and of documentation writing with passion. He's very ambitious for himself and the area of documentation writing, and happily learns new skills and researches ways to improve what he does in the sector he's in. Whilst in my team I asked him to own UX writing and he took that aspect of his role very seriously, gaining respect from his UX design peers in the work he put into learn this style of writing and the way he put the customer at the heart of his writing for them. I would hire Connor into my team again in a heartbeat, he's a credit to any team and business he works in.
