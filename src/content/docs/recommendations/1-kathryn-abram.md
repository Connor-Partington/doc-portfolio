title: Kathryn Abram, Director of Customer Experience, Wazoku
description: A recommendation given to Connor by a former manager.
---

**January 29, 2025, Kathryn managed Connor directly.**

Connor managed our support portal and while he was with us he completely revamped the structure and updated all content in the portal. He created tutorials and much needed documentation as well as UX writing for our platform.
He worked closely with Development teams to keep up to date with all the latest product changes, creating documentation for our new products and features. I could completely rely on him to independently manage projects and complete them to a high quality. He was an excellent team member and I would not hesitate to hire him again.
