**December 18, 2020, Jeff managed Connor directly.**

Connor was a pleasure to work with. He is well organised, diligent, and a fast learner. All these attributes were critical to his work in the team, which involved reaching out to a lot of people. Being a fast learner helped him understand our needs and allowed him to quickly choose the right path to success. Highly recommended.
