description: A recommendation given to Connor by a former customer.

**March 4, 2021, Sangano worked with Connor but they were at different companies.**

Connor recently joined our company for some off site training for 2 weeks. The whole team found Connor to be a very bright and keen learner. Connor was able to pick up and learn our operating system, working practises and our general day to day very quickly. We would highly recommend Connor as he showed from his time at Street Cars that he possesses the tools to become a successful professional.
