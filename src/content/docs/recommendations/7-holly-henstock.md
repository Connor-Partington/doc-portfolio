description: A recommendation given to Connor by a former manager.

**January 22, 2019, Holly managed Connor directly.**

Connor recently worked on a part time basis on various projects in the marketing office at MMU. He was extremely efficient and probably over qualified for the tasks he was asked to complete but no job was too small and he even taught me a few things on excel and outlook which now mean I can work more efficiently! I would certainly have him back if more opportunities arise!
