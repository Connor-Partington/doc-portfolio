**January 7, 2020, Jill managed Connor directly.**

I have had the pleasure of knowing Connor when I appointed him for a short-term interim assignment at CPL UK Ltd. The assignment required high levels of concentration and attention to fine detail which Connor excelled at. The project was initially to last 6-10 weeks, however, Connor clearly demonstrated an excellent work ethic, being reliable; efficient and trustworthy. Additionally, having such a broad skill set, we were keen to utilise his skills throughout the business, resulting in Connor being retained for 6 months. Connor was extremely knowledgeable around cyber security and IT improvements and I was particularly impressed with how he effectively guided the business in general, and also for the purpose of compliance. 

Connor would indeed be an asset to any company requiring his skills and comes with my heartfelt recommendation. He was certainly a very valued member of our team and I do hope Connor will return to CPL to assist with ongoing projects in 2020.
